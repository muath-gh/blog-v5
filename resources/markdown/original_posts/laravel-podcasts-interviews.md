## Introduction

Laravel is one of a kind framework.

First, it's thriving after more than 10 years of existence. There's always something new about it, which makes it hard to keep up. Podcasts are a good way to help you with that.

Secondly, it's also a business, thanks to its huge ecosystem of free and paid products. If you're interested about this side of things, you will find the right interviews in this list.

## Podcasts about Laravel

PHPUgly isn't really about Laravel, but they talk about it in almost every episode, so I guess that's fine. And I like them anyway.

This podcast is like being with your nerd friends and not taking anything too seriously.
