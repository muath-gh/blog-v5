## Introduction

There are countless platforms to learn web development and a wide range of technologies.

I've compiled a list so that you can save hours of research.

Whether you're just getting started or trying to keep your skills sharp, there will be something for you.

## How much value can I get from online learning?

Web development skills will change your life. You probably already know about this.

But did you know that school often teaches outdated knowledge and can be expensive, depending on where you live?

Learning online only has benefits for me. Here are some of them:
- Learn at your pace;
- Up-to-date courses;
- Do it from anywhere;
- Plenty of free content;
- Thousands of dollars saved and free of debts;
- Quality premium content that costs a fraction of any school's program.

## The top online web development courses

### [Codecademy](https://benjamincrozat.com/recommends/codecademy)

![Codecademy](https://life-long-bunny.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/media-library/production/115/conversions/www.codecademy.com__dhb6d1-medium.jpg)

[Codecademy](https://benjamincrozat.com/recommends/codecademy) proposes interactive courses to learn coding in the most efficient way possible. I really like this platform.

**There are free courses (no credit card required)**, but most of them are paid. I'd say it's worth it, though. They cover every topic you'll need in your career.

By the way, they also have a [forum](https://discuss.codecademy.com) on which you can ask for help and get unstuck, as well as a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@codecademy) with quality videos about various topics.

The company has been founded by Zach Sims and Ryan Bubinski (who dropped out of university). The co-founders managed to raise money and continuously grow since then until Skillsoft acquired them for $525 million.

Here are all the languages covered by Codecademy: Bash/Shell, C, C#, C++, Go, HTML & CSS, Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, PHP, Python, R, Ruby, SQL and Swift

And all the subjects: AI, cloud computing, code foundations, computer science, cybersecurity, data analytics, data engineering, data science, data visualization, developer tools, DevOps, game development, interview preparation, IT, machine learning, math, mobile development, open-source, web design and web development.

![Vue School](https://life-long-bunny.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/media-library/production/116/conversions/vueschool.io__kkb82y-medium.jpg)

[Vue School](https://vueschool.io) started in 2016 and is one of the best learning platforms for Vue.js.

**The platform has plenty of free content** that doesn't even require an account. They also publish lots of additional free content on their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@vueschool/videos).

Their premium content is available for **$25 per month (or $225 per year)**.

The creator, [Alex Kyriakidis](https://twitter.com/hootlex), started with a book that quickly became a best-selling.

Then, a premium video platform asked him for a series of videos teaching Vue.js.

It was a huge success, and Alex created Vue School to answer the increasing demand for educational content.

They cover topics like: ES6, Firebase Authentication, Firebase Realtime Database, FormKit, GraphQL, Jest, Nuxt.js, Storybook, TypeScript, unit testing, Visual Studio Code, Vite, Vitest, Vue Router, vue-i18n and Vue.js 3.

[Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) is the best place to start learning about Laravel, but also anything related to it (like JavaScript frameworks).

**It's free to watch** (there's **a lot** of free content on it), and **you don't need a credit card** to create an account.

It only costs **$11 per month** (**or $99 per year**) if you need to access premium content.

Laracasts even has a [forum](https://laracasts.com/discuss) where you can ask as many questions as you want if you're stuck on a particular topic.

Laracasts was started by Jeffrey Way back in 2014, and it's been growing since then. Nowadays, many teachers joined Jeffrey and the number of subjects and videos drastically increased.
