## Introduction

To me, Laravel is one of the best things that happened to PHP. I started using it in 2015 when version 5.1 was released, and I wish I started earlier.

It's fascinating to go back in time and have an overview of how far the framework has come.

## The latest stable version of Laravel

**The latest stable release of Laravel is version 11.** It's been publicly available since March 12, 2024. This version introduced numerous [new features and changes](/laravel-11). Laravel 11 will be supported until September 3rd, 2025 for bug fixes and until March 12th, 2026 for security fixes.

## The latest LTS (Long Term Support) release of Laravel

Nope, Laravel 11 isn't LTS. **The latest LTS release of Laravel was version 6.** It was supported from September 3rd, 2019 to September 3rd, 2022 for new releases, bug fixes, and security fixes.

Starting with Laravel 8.0, LTS versions became absolete as every new major version is supported for two years, giving everyone enough time to upgrade to next big release.

Trust my experience; if you need an LTS version of Laravel, this means something is wrong with your codebase and you should take action to fix this.

For posterity, though, here's a list of every LTS version of Laravel:
- Laravel 5.1
- Laravel 5.5
- Laravel 6

## The currently supported Laravel versions

The currently supported Laravel versions are:

- **Laravel 11**:
    - Laravel 11 is still the current version of the framework and receives weekly updates for new features, bug fixes, and security fixes.
- **Laravel 10**:
    - Laravel 10 is still supported and will receive bug fixes until August 7, 2024, and security fixes until February 7, 2025.

## See which version of Laravel you are running

Knowing which version of Laravel you are running is a crucial piece of information, whether youâ€™re planning to upgrade, debug, or simply want to ensure compatibility with a specific feature.

## Laravel versions history from 2011 to 2023

### Laravel version 1.0

If you ever asked yourself when was Laravel version 1.0 came to existence, it was **in June 2011**.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laravel), Laravel 1 included built-in support for authentication, localisation, models, views, sessions, routing and other mechanisms. But it lacked support for controllers, which prevented it from being a true MVC framework.

![Laravel's official website in 2011.](https://life-long-bunny.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/media-library/production/180/e64VXzjPj90dIkxikqTk35wXFTSw7Q-metaQ2xlYW5TaG90IDIwMjMtMDktMjAgYXQgMTMuMTUuMDdAMnguanBn-.jpg)

### Laravel version 2.0

**Laravel version 2.0 was released shortly after version 1 in September 2011.**

Some of its major new features included the support for controllers, which finally made Laravel 2 a fully MVC-compliant framework. It also included built-in support for the inversion of control (IoC) principle, and a templating system called Blade.

As a downside, support for third-party packages was removed in Laravel 2. I wasn't using Laravel at this time, but if I had to guess why support for third-party packages was removed, it's probably because the framework wasn't using Composer yet (the package manager was out for just a few months at this moment). But take it with a grain of salt.

### Laravel version 3.0

**Laravel version 3.0 was released in February 22, 2012.**

Notably, this version brought Artisan to the forefront. Additionally, it expanded its compatibility with various database systems, introduced database migrations for better layout version control, offered event handling capabilities, and unveiled a new packaging system named Bundles. This release significantly boosted Laravel's popularity.
