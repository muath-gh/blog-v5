Introducing FlappyPHPant, a straightforward rendition of the popular Flappy Bird game built on PHP-GLFW and the VISU framework.

While it looks simple, it offers a comprehensive demonstration of how you could build a 2D game with these tools.

It showcases an array of features including decoupled simulation from rendering, a proper 2D camera, abstracted input handling, an entity component system, a simple sprite renderer, basic AABB collision detection and text rendering, among others.

The game's simulation runs at a fixed rate, allowing for smooth player movement. It also adjusts readily to varying screen resolutions and aspect ratios. Though light on action – you basically press one button to play – it offers rich learning material for budding game developers.
