## Introduction

Laravel is the most popular PHP framework for web developers. It's currently used by the most performing companies in the world and for good reasons. There even are people like me who make a living blogging about it.

So, can **you** make a living coding web applications using Laravel in your country? That's for you to find out. I provide data compiled from sources such as [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/index.htm), [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com), and [PayScale](https://www.payscale.com), which is probably far to be accurate, but a good basis to decide if Laravel is worth learning.

**Ultimately, keep in mind that your salary will depend on your negociation skills.**
